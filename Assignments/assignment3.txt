Assignment 3: Symbolic execution
DUE DATE:  4/20/20

1.  Create a subdirectory in your class repo called assignment3

2.  Write a small DeepState harness (test + function to test) that you
think fuzzing will do well on and symbolic execution will do poorly
on, call it fuzzingwins.cpp

3.  Write a small DeepState harness (test + function to test) that you
think symbolic execution will do well on and fuzzing will do poorly
on, call it symexwins.cpp.  You can't reuse my Pythagorean triples example :)

4.  Write an appropriate Makefile.

5.  Run various fuzzers, AFL, the deepstate --fuzz, libfuzzer,
eclipser, maybe honggfuzz, then try symbolic execution with angr and/or manticore

6.  Discuss your results in a file, results.txt.  You're gonna want at
least 600 words here.  More is fine.  Explain why your fuzzingwins
favors fuzzing, and your symexwins favors symex.  Which is more
realistic code?
