# CLASS 15:

* More DeepState, this time a look at the stack example

* Introduced swarm testing (see https://agroce.github.io/issta12.pdf)

* See file swarm.txt; we could find the stack "bug" in no time with swarm, not find it in hours without using it

* DeepState lets us apply meta-heuristics, "extra tricks" on top of fuzzers like AFL/libFuzzer

* See unittestsort.txt for a preview of Monday
