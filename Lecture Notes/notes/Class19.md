# CLASS 19:

* The midterm will be Friday of the week assignment 2 is due; we'll review Mon & Wed

* We looked at simulating hardware.  Why?  Real hardware is slow, hard to inject faults in, and may be expensive/dangerous to mess with/not exist

* We looked at simulated resets in https://github.com/agroce/testfs

* Injecting faults via fuzzing is a really good way to poke holes in even good embedded code
