# CLASS 22:

* Triage is as important as bug-finding: report, effectively, unique
bugs

* Need to REDUCE test cases to something minimal (deepstate-reduce
will help) -- read https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/11/11/test-case-reduction/

* Domain knowledge helps understand which bugs look nastiest

* Art, not a science

* The easy case is when each kind of bug has a specific crash output
(assertion on line X, segfault at Y, etc.)
