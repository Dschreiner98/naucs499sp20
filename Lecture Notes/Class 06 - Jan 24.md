# CLASS 6:  We're finishing up the intro to fuzzing

**[ASSIGNMENT 1](https://github.com/agroce/naucs499sp20/blob/master/assignment1.txt) 
went out**

* Topic:  command line options for fuzzers, esp. -use_value_profile=1
* Topic:  fuzzer behavior depends on two things (well, lots of things,
but):
* * Notion of WHAT IS INTERESTING BEHAVIOR?
* * How to modify/mutate files
* There is no "best fuzzer" -- need to run many, hope to get lucky!
