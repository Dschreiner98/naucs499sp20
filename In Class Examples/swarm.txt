Traditional test generation always uses "the kitchen sink"

E.g, if our API is

push(n)
pop()
clear()

it will call all three with equal probability.

Question:  what is the mean stack size?

(1/3)^10
(1/7)^64

Swarm testing flips a coin for each API call before starting each test.  If the coin is tails, never call that API call.
