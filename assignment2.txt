Assignment 2: DeepState
DUE DATE:  3/9/20

1.  Create a subdirectory in your class repo called assignment2

2.  Find some interesting API: a library with multiple functions to
call, and (moderately) interesting properties beyond purely "does not
crash".  An obvious example would be some "safe" replacement for
string.h.  It should still do what strcat etc do on valid inputs

3.  Write a DeepState harness to test this API.  Ideally, actually
commit a version of the code under test in your repo, otherwise add
info on how to grab it and compile it for DeepState use

4.  Write an appropriate Makefile.

5.  Run various fuzzers, AFL, the deepstate --fuzz one, libfuzzer,
eclipser, maybe honggfuzz, even try symbolic executors; have fun, try
swarm testing

6.  Discuss your results in a file, results.txt.  You're gonna want at least 800 words here.  More is fine.
